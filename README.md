## Profile Summary

I am a backend-focused software engineer with hands-on experience building **scalable APIs**, **microservices-based systems**, and **modern web applications**.  
My engineering approach emphasizes **clean architecture**, **maintainable code**, and **practical system design**.

I primarily work with **FastAPI**, event-driven communication, and containerized environments, and I enjoy solving backend problems that require clarity, reliability, and long-term scalability.

I am actively seeking opportunities where I can contribute to meaningful products, collaborate with experienced engineers, and continue growing as a backend-focused developer.
